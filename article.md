# JSON Validator & Formatter: Simplify Your JSON Workflow

The JSON Validator & Formatter tool on sanjaykumar.pro streamlines working with JSON data. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs in your browser, ensuring speed and privacy without external dependencies.

Validate JSON for syntax errors, format it with clean indentation, or minify it for compact use. Features include syntax highlighting, a collapsible tree view, and error line detection for quick debugging. Copy results to your clipboard or download them as a `.json` file. A dark/light theme toggle enhances readability.

Perfect for developers and data analysts, this tool boosts productivity with a simple, intuitive interface.

### Functional Features Implemented in this Tool:

1.  **JSON Validation**: Checks if input JSON is valid; displays detailed errors including approximate line numbers. Updates on input. Last input saved via `localStorage`.
2.  **JSON Formatting (Pretty Print)**: Formats JSON with 2-space indentation. Output is syntax-highlighted.
3.  **Minify JSON**: Removes unnecessary whitespace. Output is syntax-highlighted.
4.  **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies the content of the output area (formatted/minified JSON) to the clipboard. Uses modern Clipboard API with fallback.
5.  **Clear Input Button**: Resets input, output areas, and validation messages. Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl + R` / `Cmd + R`.
6.  **Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights JSON keys, values (strings, numbers, booleans), and nulls in the output display.
7.  **Error Line Highlighting**: Indicates the approximate line number of syntax errors. Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + E` / `Cmd + E` focuses on the error message.
8.  **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Switches between dark and light themes. Preference saved in `localStorage`.
9.  **JSON Tree View**: Displays JSON as an expandable/collapsible tree structure. Updates dynamically with input.
10. **Export as JSON File**: Downloads the current JSON (pretty-printed if valid, raw otherwise) as a `.json` file. Allows custom filenames.

### Implementation Notes Summary:
*   **HTML**: Uses `<textarea>` for input, `<pre>` for highlighted output, `<div>` for tree view, and `<button>` elements.
*   **CSS**: Uses `flexbox` for layout, CSS variables for theming (implicitly via class toggles), and `transition`/`@keyframes` for animations.
*   **JavaScript**: Modular functions for each feature, event listeners for interactivity. `localStorage` used for input persistence and theme preference.
*   **Article SEO**: Targets "JSON validator," "JSON formatter," includes platform URL, and links to a related tool.
